Description: An incredibly stupid web server
 averell is an incredibly simple, but fast, web server based on the
 erlang/OTP application cowboy.
 .
 It is as simple to use as starting in a directory to serve it on
 port 8000 (default). Basic options include: enabling CORS,
 changing port, redirecting directories to index.html, etc.
 .
